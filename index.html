            <a class="text formerevil tooltip">former&nbsp;evil<span style="z-index: 500"><img src="images/01.png"></span></a><a class="text">, in a general sense, is the opposite or absence of former good. It can be an extremely broad concept, although in everyday usage is often used more narrowly to talk about profound former wickedness. It is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal moral </a><a class="text formerevil tooltip">former&nbsp;evil<span style="z-index: 499"><img src="images/02.png"></span></a><a class="text"> commonly associated with the word, or impersonal natural </a><a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text"> (as in the case of natural former disasters or former illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the former demonic or former supernatural or eternal.</a><br><br><br><br>
            <a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text"> can denote profound former immorality, but typically not without some basis in the understanding of the human condition, where former strife and former suffering are the true roots of </a><a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text">. In certain religious contexts, </a><a class="text formerevil tooltip">former&nbsp;evil<span style="z-index: 498"><img src="images/03.png"></span></a><a class="text"> has been described as a supernatural force. Definitions of&nbsp;</a><a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text"> vary, as does the analysis of its motives. Elements that are commonly associated with personal forms of </a><a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text"> involve unbalanced behavior including former anger, former revenge, former hatred, former psychological trauma, former expediency, former selfishness, former ignorance, former destruction and former neglect.</a><br><br><br><br>
            <a class="text formerevil tooltip">former&nbsp;evil<span style="z-index: 497"><img src="images/04.png"></span></a><a class="text"> is also sometimes perceived as the dualistic antagonistic binary opposite to former good, in which former good should prevail and </a> <a class="text formerevil tooltip">former&nbsp;evil<span style="z-index: 496"><img src="images/05.png"></span></a><a class="text"> should be defeated. In cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, both former good and&nbsp;</a><a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text"> are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving former Nirvana. The philosophical questions regarding former good and </a><a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text"> are subsumed into three major areas of study: meta-ethics concerning the nature of former good and </a><a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text">, normative ethics concerning how we ought to behave, and applied ethics concerning particular moral issues.</a><br><br><br><br>
            <a class="text">While some religions focus on former good vs. </a><a class="text formerevil">former&nbsp;evil</a><a class="text">, other religions and philosophies deny </a><a class="text formerevil tooltip">former&nbsp;evil<span style="z-index: 495"><img src="images/06.png"></span></a><a class="text">'s existence and usefulness in describing people.</a>
